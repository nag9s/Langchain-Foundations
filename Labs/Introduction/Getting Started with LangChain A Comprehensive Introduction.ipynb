    "1. **Importing the ChatOllama Class**\n",
    "   - The `ChatOllama` class is used to interact with the Ollama LLM (Large Language Model) API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining the Base URL and Model**\n",
    "   - **`base_url`**: Specifies the URL where the Ollama server is running or cloud llm api endpoint is running. In this case, it is hosted locally on port `11434`.\n",
    "   - **`model`**: Defines the specific LLM model to use. Here, the model is `llama3.2:1b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating an Instance of ChatOllama**\n",
    "   - An instance of the `ChatOllama` class is created with the following parameters:\n",
    "     - **`base_url`**: The URL of the Ollama server.\n",
    "     - **`model`**: The LLM model to use.\n",
    "     - **`temperature`**: Controls the randomness of the model's output. A value of `0.8` allows for some creativity while maintaining coherence.\n",
    "     - **`num_predict`**: Specifies the maximum number of tokens to predict in the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Invoking the Model with a Prompt**\n",
    "   - The `invoke` method sends a prompt to the LLM and retrieves the response.\n",
    "   - The prompt in this case is: *\"Please explain langchain using 5 simple usecases.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Printing the Response**\n",
    "   - The `print` function is used to display the content of the response received from the LLM.\n",
    "   - The `response.content` contains the text generated by the model based on the provided prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This code demonstrates how to use the `ChatOllama` class to interact with an Ollama LLM.\n",
    "- It initializes the model with specific parameters, sends a prompt, and prints the generated response.\n",
    "- This is useful for generating natural language explanations or other text-based outputs."

      "LangChain is a cutting-edge, open-source, and highly scalable text-based conversation AI platform that enables users to engage in natural language conversations with chatbots. It utilizes a unique architecture that combines the strengths of various AI technologies, including transformers, attention mechanisms, and neural networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are two detailed and distinct use cases for LangChain:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Use Case 1: Customer Support Chatbots**\n",
      "\n",
      "LangChain can be used as a robust customer support chatbot platform to provide personalized assistance to customers. The platform's architecture allows it to handle complex conversations with multiple intents (e.g., order status, product information, returns) and entities (e.g., names, locations). LangChain's transformer-based model enables it to understand the nuances of human language, including idioms, colloquialisms, and sarcasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a customer inquiries about an order status by saying \"I ordered 2 items last week, but they haven't arrived yet.\" The chatbot would respond with \"Sorry to hear that. Can you please check your order details? I can also escalate this issue if needed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The LangChain platform's ability to handle multiple intents and entities enables it to provide accurate and relevant responses to customers. Additionally, the chatbot's conversational flow is designed to guide users through a natural dialogue, making it easier for them to resolve their issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Use Case 2: Language Translation and Text Analysis**\n",
      "\n",
      "LangChain can be used as a powerful language translation tool and text analysis platform to extract insights from large volumes of text data. The platform's architecture enables it to process and analyze text in real-time, using advanced techniques such as machine learning-based models (e.g., word embeddings, named entity recognition) and deep learning algorithms (e.g., transformers).\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a researcher uses LangChain to analyze a large corpus of text data to identify key concepts, entities, and relationships. The platform's ability to handle complex linguistic structures and nuances enables it to provide accurate and relevant insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "One possible use case is to develop a language translation tool that can accurately translate technical documents from one language to another. For instance, a company wants to translate its website content into Chinese for international markets. LangChain can be used to analyze the text data and identify key concepts, entities, and relationships, enabling the development of accurate and relevant translations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this scenario, LangChain's ability to handle complex linguistic structures and nuances enables it to provide accurate and relevant translations. The platform's advanced algorithms also enable it to detect subtle differences in language usage, cultural references, and\n"

    "# Streaming Responses in LangChain\n",
    "Streaming refers to the process of receiving data in small, incremental chunks rather than waiting for the entire response to be available. This is particularly useful when interacting with large language models (LLMs) that generate lengthy outputs, as it allows you to process and display the response in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of LangChain and the `ChatOllama` class, streaming enables you to retrieve and handle the model's output as it is being generated. This can improve user experience by providing immediate feedback and reducing perceived latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code demonstrates how streaming works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = \"\"\n",
    "for chunk in llm.stream('Please explain langchain using exactly 2 detailed and distinct use cases.'):\n",
    "    response = response + \" \" + chunk.content\n",
    "    print(response)\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. **`llm.stream()`**: This method sends a prompt to the LLM and returns a generator that yields chunks of the response as they are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterating Over Chunks**: The `for` loop iterates over each chunk of the response. Each chunk contains a portion of the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Building the Response**: The `response` variable accumulates the content of all chunks to form the complete response.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-Time Output**: The `print(response)` statement displays the response incrementally, providing real-time feedback as the model generates the output."
