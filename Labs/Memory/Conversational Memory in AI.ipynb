    "SQLChatMessageHistory is a utility that enables conversational AI systems to retain context across multiple exchanges by storing the chat history in a SQL database. This ensures that the assistant can maintain continuity across sessions, even if the application is restarted or accessed from a different device. In the cells below, SQLChatMessageHistory is used to persist chat histories for different sessions, allowing the assistant to provide context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Methods and Concepts:\n",
    "- **`invoke`**: Executes the chain with the provided input and includes the conversation history in the process.\n",
    "- **`input_messages_key`**: Specifies the key in the input dictionary where the user's message is stored.\n",
    "- **`history_messages_key`**: Specifies the key where the conversation history is injected into the chain.\n",
    "- **`get_session_history`**: A function to retrieve or create a session-specific chat history, ensuring continuity across interactions by leveraging a SQL database.\n"
