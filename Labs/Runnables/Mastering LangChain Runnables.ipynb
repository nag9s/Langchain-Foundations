    "### Composition Primitives  \n",
    "LangChain provides two main composition primitives for creating Runnables:  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. RunnableSequence  \n",
    "- Allows chaining multiple Runnables sequentially  \n",
    "- The output of one Runnable becomes the input for the next  \n",
    "- Can be created using the pipe operator (`|`) or explicitly with `RunnableSequence`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = runnable1 | runnable2  # Sequential execution\n",
    "# Output of runnable1 feeds into runnable2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. RunnableParallel  \n",
    "- Runs multiple Runnables concurrently with the same input  \n",
    "- Returns a dictionary with results from each Runnable  \n",
    "- Executes Runnables in parallel, significantly reducing processing time  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "parallel_chain = RunnableParallel({\n",
    "    \"key1\": runnable1,\n",
    "    \"key2\": runnable2\n",
    "})\n",
    "# Both runnables run concurrently with the same input\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Composition Features  \n",
    "- Automatic type coercion (functions become `RunnableLambda`, dictionaries become `RunnableParallel`)  \n",
    "- Support for async and sync execution  \n",
    "- Optimized parallel processing using thread pools  \n",

      "LangChain is a blockchain-based knowledge graph database that enables the creation of scalable, secure, and decentralized knowledge graphs. It allows users to store, query, and share knowledge in a structured and organized manner, making it an attractive solution for various applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are two detailed and distinct use cases for LangChain:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Use Case 1: Knowledge Graph-based Content Recommendation**\n",
      "\n",
      "In this scenario, LangChain is used as a knowledge graph database to build a content recommendation system. The system consists of a large corpus of text data, which includes information about entities (people, organizations, locations), relationships between them, and concepts related to those entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The LangChain database is populated with this text data, which serves as the foundation for creating a knowledge graph. The graph represents various entities, their relationships, and associated concepts, allowing users to query and retrieve relevant content based on specific criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, when a user searches for information about a particular topic or entity, the system queries the LangChain database to retrieve relevant articles, videos, or other content that are related to the searched term. This process is facilitated by the graph's ability to efficiently traverse relationships between entities and concepts, enabling accurate and personalized recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Use Case 2: Collaborative Knowledge Graph Development**\n",
      "\n",
      "In this scenario, LangChain is used as a collaborative platform for knowledge graph development among multiple users. The system allows developers to create, share, and modify knowledge graphs in real-time, making it an ideal solution for collaborative projects that require the creation of complex knowledge structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The LangChain database serves as the underlying infrastructure for these collaborative efforts, providing a scalable and secure environment for users to store, query, and share their knowledge graphs. The system's features include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* User authentication and authorization\n",
      "* Knowledge graph editing and management\n",
      "* Collaboration tools (e.g., commenting, @mentions)\n",
      "* Data synchronization and backup\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, multiple developers can work on creating a shared knowledge graph in LangChain, which enables them to collaborate on the creation of complex relationships between entities and concepts. They can also share their graphs with each other, allowing for seamless integration and comparison of their work. The system's scalability and security features ensure that the collaborative platform remains stable and reliable even during large-scale projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In both use cases, LangChain's ability to store, query, and manage complex knowledge structures makes it an attractive solution for various applications, from content recommendation systems to collaborative knowledge graph development platforms.\n"
