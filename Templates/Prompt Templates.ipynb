    "# Prompt Templates\n",
    "Prompt Templates are a powerful way to define reusable and parameterized prompts for language models. They allow you to create dynamic prompts by using placeholders that can be replaced with specific values at runtime. This approach simplifies the process of generating customized prompts for various use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Langchain Chat Prompt Templates are specifically designed for multi-turn conversations. They allow you to define structured prompts that include both system and user messages, making them ideal for chat-based interactions. While Prompt Templates focus on single-turn prompts with placeholders, Chat Prompt Templates provide additional flexibility for managing conversational context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we discuss two methods to work with Prompt Templates:\n",
    "1. Using the `from_template()` method for quick and convenient creation of templates.\n",
    "2. Creating a `PromptTemplate` object explicitly with input variables for more customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics of PromptTemplate\n",
    "- Works with a single string template  \n",
    "- Uses simple `{variable}` placeholders  \n",
    "- Best for straightforward, single-message prompts  \n",
    "- Outputs a single formatted string  "
