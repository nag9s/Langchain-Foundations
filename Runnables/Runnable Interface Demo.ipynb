    "# Runnables: Definition and Characteristics  \n",
    "A Runnable is a fundamental unit in LangChain that provides a standard interface for various components with the following key capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Characteristics of Runnables  \n",
    "A unit of work that can be:  \n",
    "- **Invoked** (transform a single input into an output)  \n",
    "- **Batched** (transform multiple inputs efficiently)  \n",
    "- **Streamed** (produce outputs incrementally)  \n",
    "- **Composed** (combined with other Runnables)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Composition Primitives  \n",
    "LangChain provides two main composition primitives for creating Runnables:  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. RunnableSequence  \n",
    "- Allows chaining multiple Runnables sequentially  \n",
    "- The output of one Runnable becomes the input for the next  \n",
    "- Can be created using the pipe operator (`|`) or explicitly with `RunnableSequence`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = runnable1 | runnable2  # Sequential execution\n",
    "# Output of runnable1 feeds into runnable2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. RunnableParallel  \n",
    "- Runs multiple Runnables concurrently with the same input  \n",
    "- Returns a dictionary with results from each Runnable  \n",
    "- Executes Runnables in parallel, significantly reducing processing time  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "parallel_chain = RunnableParallel({\n",
    "    \"key1\": runnable1,\n",
    "    \"key2\": runnable2\n",
    "})\n",
    "# Both runnables run concurrently with the same input\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Composition Features  \n",
    "- Automatic type coercion (functions become `RunnableLambda`, dictionaries become `RunnableParallel`)  \n",
    "- Support for async and sync execution  \n",
    "- Optimized parallel processing using thread pools  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of LCEL Composition  \n",
    "- Optimized parallel execution  \n",
    "- Guaranteed async support  \n",
    "- Simplified streaming  \n",
    "- Seamless tracing with LangSmith  \n",
    "- Standard API across different components  \n"
